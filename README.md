## Project setup
```
npm install 
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
### Improvement Mades
1. The responsiveness of the website is not complete. Reason being the ipad/ipad pro view is not complete so i have made that responsive for tablet too.
2. The hover for the register/new user is weird, i made the hover & active effect look better.

### Notes
1. Spent some time to figure out the axios get link for the api due to CORS policy error, fixed it but in the domain still have the error. 
2. Making owl carousel dynamic is the hard part due to DOM load first then do the axios so i added a function to do the axios then load the owl carousel script.
3. I have followed the design given as close as possible, i make several template component so i can easily use back the components when needed.
